					<p class="lead">
						We seek to host regular seminars educating community members about technology. We would like to both host seminars on technology/computer science-related topics and work with community members on a one-on-one basis to address their specific questions. This would encompass things like working with elderly people to understand how to use their phones or social media better, educating community members on anti-virus software, and anything else that the community needs.

					<p class="lead">
						We are actively developing a robotics club at Culler Middle School to introduce the fundamentals of computer science and opportunities to students even before they reach High School. This club will expose children to electronics, promote creativity and teamwork, and foster critical thinking skills that will be beneficial in solving problems in any situation.

					<h3 class="section-heading">Open Development Sprint Space</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						The goal of this project is to host open development “sprints” on a regular basis. This space would be similar to a hack-a-thon, but on a smaller scale and a much more consistent, regular basis. Members of the CSE Ambassadors could use this block of time to develop software tools for non-profits or work on other projects, but all are welcome. This space will help foster collaboration and companionship within the UNL CSE student community.

					<h3 class="section-heading">Community Software Solution</h3>
					<p class="lead">
						One of our founding goals was to develop software tools for RSOs, non-profits, and other groups that would not have access otherwise. Our first project is to develop software for UNL’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. This software will be used to organize client meetings and relieve the stress that comes with that. We will also be working with the Non-Profit Hub in downtown Lincoln to assist other local non-profits.
